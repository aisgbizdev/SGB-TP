// Radical AI transparency dashboard (task #164). Aggregates the public
// outcome ledger across *all* users and surfaces rolling 30/90-day
// hit-rates per instrument, FX session, and market-condition bucket —
// plus a "current state" honesty banner that fires when the recent
// window meaningfully underperforms the longer baseline.
//
// What counts:
//   * wins   = analyses whose `outcomeStatus` resolved to `tp1_hit` or `tp2_hit`
//   * losses = analyses whose `outcomeStatus` resolved to `sl_hit`
//   * expired = window passed without TP or SL touch (no-fill)
// `invalidated` and `pending` are excluded entirely.
//
// Two rates are reported, deliberately separated to keep the honesty
// promise:
//   * winRate    = wins / (wins + losses)  — among trades that actually triggered
//   * hitRate    = wins / total            — over every resolved analysis, expired included
//
// Every segment respects a minimum-sample guardrail (`MIN_SAMPLE`) so
// the page never confidently states a "78% win rate" pulled from 4 trades.
