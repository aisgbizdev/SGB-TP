## Projects

### AI Trading Assistant MVP (`artifacts/ai-trading`)
Mobile-first PWA (React+Vite) for trading decision-support (NOT a signal generator).
The PWA is the current way to view and use the product conveniently on phones while iterating; the intended longer-term direction is a native phone app. Treat the PWA as the present experience, not as a direct substitute for native implementation.

**Features:**
- Auth: the built-in login system (password, Google/Apple/Facebook/TikTok, sessions) was removed. Identity comes from one seam, `resolveIdentity` / `setIdentityResolver` in `artifacts/api-server/src/middleware/auth.ts`; the replacement login (external user API over WebSocket) plugs in there. Interim: every request is `DEFAULT_USER_ID` (seed with `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run seed:super-admin`), and the server refuses to boot in production on that stub unless `ALLOW_DEFAULT_IDENTITY_IN_PRODUCTION=true`. Auth tables/columns were dropped (`lib/db/sql/0001_remove_builtin_auth.sql`). Only `GET /auth/me` and `PATCH /auth/profile` remain. `docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` is obsolete.
- TradePilot client-area API (`/v1/trade-pilot`, `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/trade-pilot.ts`; helpers in `lib/trade-pilot*.ts`): server-to-server REST per "Requirement API - TradePilot". All 12 endpoints are implemented. Auth = `Authorization: Bearer $TRADE_PILOT_API_KEY` + `X-TradePilot-User` (opaque id). One local `users` row per `(external_id, account_mode)` so demo/real credits+history are separate; auto-provisioned on first call. Credits reuse the credit ledger, topped up monthly to `TRADE_PILOT_ALLOWANCE_DEMO` (5) / `_REAL` (50). `POST /analyses` needs `Idempotency-Key` (`tp_idempotency_keys`) and reuses `createAnalysisHandler`. Known gaps: contract timeframe "M" unsupported; contractSpecs margin is null (unknown); price-alert delivery channel undecided (status is readable, nothing is pushed to client-area users); news `impact` is a keyword heuristic; marketContext is Indonesian only. Migrations: `lib/db/sql/0002_*`, `0003_*`.
- Legacy `/api` (web app, mobile app, admin panel) is disabled when `NODE_ENV=production` unless `LEGACY_API_ENABLED=true` (only `/api/healthz` stays); its identity is still the single-user stub.
- Two user modes: Pemula (Beginner) and Pro
- Dark/light mode toggle in header (useCallback-stabilized setTheme, useLayoutEffect for synchronous DOM class, inline script in index.html for FOUC prevention)
- Dashboard with statistics cards
- AI Analysis page: GPT-4o analysis, timeframe validity badges, animated loading messages
  - Per-user quota: max 5 analyses/hour and 20/day (configurable via `ANALYSIS_QUOTA_PER_HOUR` / `ANALYSIS_QUOTA_PER_DAY` env vars). Returns 429 with Indonesian message on overrun. Admins/super_admins bypass.
- Analysis detail with confidence bar, validity countdown, feedback system
- History with filtering
- Personal Analytics with recharts charts
- Notification system (user/admin/super_admin roles)
- Onboarding modal for new users (non-dismissable until completed)
- Admin panel: stats, all analyses, broadcast, user CRUD
- PWA: vite-plugin-pwa with injectManifest strategy, custom service worker (`src/sw.ts`), Workbox caching + push event handler
- Web Push Notifications: VAPID keys (env: VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY, VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY, VAPID_EMAIL), push subscription management, opt-in toggle on notifications page
- Push sent on admin broadcast + analysis expiry alerts (background jobs, hourly)

**Colors:** Primary light `#1e3a5f`, Primary dark `#3b82f6`, Dark bg `#0f172a`
**Language:** All UI text in Indonesian
**Users:** DR (main user), Rere (AI agent name)

**Brand identity and sponsor (SOLID PRIME).** The official product name is **TradePilot.id**; use **TradePilot** only in longer narrative copy. Never use the spaced forms “Trade Pilot” / “TRADE PILOT”, never add “by SGB”, and keep the slogan exactly **UNIVERSE COMES TO US** without a period. **SOLID PRIME**, the mini-account product of PT Solid Gold Berjangka (BAPPEBTI-regulated futures broker, Member JFX & ICH), may appear only as a separately labeled sponsor rather than as part of the product identity. SP sponsor surfaces link to `https://www.sg-berjangka.com`, with dedicated CTA cards on `landing.tsx` (`section-solid-prime-cta`) and `profile.tsx` (`card-solid-prime-cta`), plus a "Live Analisa" dashboard banner linking to `https://www.tiktok.com/@solid.prime`. Locale keys live under `t.brand.*` (sponsored_by, news_data_via, solid_prime_subline, solid_prime_regulated, open_account_cta, open_account_subtitle, live_analisa_*). **Newsmaker.id is content-source attribution only** (news widget, calendar widget, technical-indicators panel, dashboard live-prices fallback) and is referenced in chrome via the secondary "News data via newsmaker.id" line; the operator-of-record reference in legal intros and `CONTACT_EMAIL=support@newsmaker.id` are unchanged. A "Sponsorship Disclosure" paragraph is appended to **section 6 of the Terms** (EN + ID) describing the SP relationship and editorial independence. The `.btn-premium` button class already bakes a dark text color (`#1a1208`) — never combine it with `text-white`. SP CTAs use `btn-premium` with an `ArrowUpRight` icon.

### API Server (`artifacts/api-server`)
Express backend serving all APIs.

**Routes:**
- `/api/auth/*` — register, login, logout, me, forgot-password (3-step via security question), profile, change-password, change-security-question, google + google/callback (OAuth 2.0)
- `/api/analyses/*` — CRUD + summary + recent-instruments + personal-analytics + feedback
- `/api/notifications/*` — list, mark-read, mark-all-read, count, **stream (SSE realtime push)**
- `/api/push/*` — public-key (public), subscribe/unsubscribe/subscription-status (authenticated), **prefs (GET/PATCH per-channel toggles: pushExpiry, pushBroadcast)**
- `/api/admin/*` — stats, all-analyses, broadcast (now also sends Web Push), user CRUD (admin/super_admin only)

**Key libs:** bcryptjs, openai (gpt-4o), cookie-parser, drizzle-orm, pg, web-push (VAPID Web Push notifications)

### Database (`lib/db`)
PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM. Tables: users, sessions, passwordResetTokens, analyses, feedback, notifications, push_subscriptions.

**Enums:** user_role (user/admin/super_admin), user_mode (beginner/pro), theme_preference (light/dark/system), market_condition (bullish/bearish/sideways), confidence_level (low/medium/high/very_high).

### API Spec + Codegen (`lib/api-spec`, `lib/api-client-react`, `lib/api-zod`)
OpenAPI spec → Orval codegen → React Query hooks + Zod schemas.
After codegen: fix `lib/api-zod/src/index.ts` to only export from `"./generated/api"` (avoids duplicate export error).

## Timeframe Validity Periods
- 1m: 15 min | 5m: 1h | 15m: 2.5h | 1h: 5h | 4h: 18h | 1D: 36h | 1W: 96h

## Historical Data Retention
- **Analyses**: 90-day retention (env-overridable via `ANALYSES_RETENTION_DAYS`, clamped 30–365). A daily background job deletes analyses older than the window; `feedback` rows cascade automatically. A second daily job sends an in-app notification 7 days before deletion.
- **Sessions / password reset tokens**: pruned by their own `expiresAt` columns (no TTL job needed).
- **Notifications**: kept indefinitely (user-driven cleanup via mark-read / delete UI).

## Production Database Resilience
- Single shared `pg.Pool` lives in `lib/db/src/index.ts` (api-server re-exports it). No duplicate pools.
- `pool.on('error')` handler swallows idle-client TCP drops from managed Postgres providers (Neon etc.) so Node never crashes from an unhandled error event.
- TLS: strict cert verification by default whenever `sslmode=require/verify-*` is in `DATABASE_URL` or in production. Set `PGSSL_INSECURE=true` ONLY for self-signed dev DBs (logs a loud warning if used in production).
- Graceful shutdown: SIGTERM/SIGINT stops background jobs first, then closes the HTTP server, then drains the pool (10s force-exit fallback). Prevents lingering connections after deploy restarts.

See the `pnpm-workspace` skill for workspace structure, TypeScript setup, and package details.

## Production Routing

In production the workspace path-router has two backends: **api-server** runs as the Cloud Run autoscale service and serves `/api/*`, while **ai-trading** is built ahead of time and served as **static files** (`serve = "static"`, `publicDir = "dist/public"`) at `/`. Both artifacts have their own `[services.production]` block — without one for ai-trading, the path-router has no backend for the root URL and the deployer either fails ("no run command provided") or returns a synthetic 500 on `GET /`. The api-server's Express app no longer needs to host the SPA in production (the static service does), but the SPA fallback in `src/app.ts` is kept as a harmless safety net. In dev nothing changes: ai-trading's Vite dev server owns `/` and api-server's Express owns `/api`.

## Before You Publish

Production gets its own Postgres database (separate `DATABASE_URL` from dev). Two things must be in place before clicking Publish:

**1. Review Replit's generated database migration.**
Keep the development database aligned with `lib/db/src/schema/index.ts` using the dev-only schema command or the post-merge setup. Replit Publish compares development with production and applies the reviewed migration. The production build must never run `drizzle-kit push`, `push-force`, startup-time DDL, or a custom production migration script. Cancel publishing if its SQL preview contains unexpected `DROP`, `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, table reset, or data-overwrite operations.

**2. Add these secrets yourself in the Publishing → Secrets pane:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — **required**. Without it, every `/api/analyses` request fails (no AI analysis).
- `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` — **required for push notifications**. Without it the server logs a warning and silently skips Web Push (but the app still runs).

Auto-provided by the platform — do not set manually:
- `DATABASE_URL` — injected automatically when the deployment's database is attached.

Already covered by `[userenv.shared]` in `.replit` and carried into production automatically: `OPENAI_MODEL`, `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_EMAIL`. No action needed for these.

Optional tuning vars (defaults are fine for most cases): `ANALYSIS_QUOTA_PER_HOUR` (default 5), `ANALYSIS_QUOTA_PER_DAY` (default 20), `LOG_LEVEL` (default `info`).

## Fundamental Pipeline (Task #88)

Every `/api/analyses` POST now builds a **fundamental snapshot** that is fed to the AI *and* persisted on the row, so the AI's `keyDriversFundamental` is grounded in real, auditable inputs instead of generic templates.

**Sources (server-side, parallel fetch):**
- `lib/news.ts` merges **newsmaker.id** (HTML scrape, ID-language) + **Yahoo Finance per-symbol RSS** (`lib/news-yahoo.ts`, regex XML parse, no API key) — deduped by URL+normalized title. Filter relaxes to a `MACRO_FALLBACK_PATTERN` (FOMC/CPI/NFP/PCE/etc.) when no instrument-specific match exists, and always keeps ≥1 Yahoo headline as a baseline. Body trimmed to 600 chars in the prompt; source badge included.
- `lib/calendar.ts` accepts `lookbackHours` (default **24h**) so freshly-released actuals (e.g. NFP from this morning) still appear, not just future events.

**OpenAI (`lib/openai.ts`):**
- `generateAnalysis(instrument, timeframe, mode, notes?, indicatorContext?, fundamentalSnapshot?)` — 6-arg signature.
- Output schema gains optional `fundamentalCitations: { newsTitles[], calendarEvents[] }`.
- `validateFundamentalCitations` enforces every cited title/event is a substring of the snapshot OR shares ≥2 token overlap, AND that the citations array is non-empty when the snapshot is non-empty. If validation fails, the call **retries once** with a corrective system message; if it still fails, `generateAnalysis` **throws** so the route returns a clean AI-error path (HTTP 502, AI quota refunded) — ungrounded fundamental prose is never persisted.
- Prompt rule: when the snapshot block is non-empty the model **must** quote ≥1 item by name into citations; when empty it must say "tidak ada katalis fundamental signifikan" and leave citations empty.

**Persistence:** `analyses.fundamentalContext jsonb` (typed `FundamentalContextShape` in `lib/db/src/schema/index.ts`) stores `{ newsItems, calendarEvents }`. Exposed via `Analysis.fundamentalContext` in `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` and the regenerated client types.

**UI (`analysis-detail.tsx`):** `FundamentalContextCard` renders below the trade plan when `fundamentalContext` is present — shows up to 3 news items (title + source + relative time + click-through) and up to 5 calendar rows (event + currency + impact + actual/forecast/previous), with an empty state. Locale keys live under `analysis_detail.fundamental_*` (EN + ID).

**Tests:** `lib/__tests__/news.test.ts` (merge/dedupe + macro fallback + sanitizer), `lib/__tests__/calendar.test.ts` (lookback datetime + sanitizer), `lib/__tests__/openai-citations.test.ts` (citation validation matrix + integration test that `generateAnalysis` throws when the retry is still ungrounded), `routes/__tests__/analyses-30m.test.ts` (asserts `fundamentalSnapshot` is the 6th arg + persisted on the response), `pages/__tests__/analysis-detail.test.tsx` (renders card with data, empty-state, and asserts 3/5 caps + `target=_blank` on news links), `tests/e2e/tests/analyze-30m.spec.ts` (asserts `card-fundamental-context` renders the stub headline + FOMC event).
