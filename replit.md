# TradePilot.id — SGB-TP

Imported application from https://github.com/aisgbizdev/SGB-TP.git. Preserve the existing product, pages, authentication and database schema rather than redesigning them.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (port 5000)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

- Web PWA: `artifacts/ai-trading`; API: `artifacts/api-server`.
- Database schema: `lib/db/src/schema/index.ts`.
- API contract and generated clients: `lib/api-spec`, `lib/api-client-react`, `lib/api-zod`.
- Original mobile companion source: `artifacts/mobile`; it is not yet registered or verified as a mobile preview here.
- Native mobile dependencies and the optional Dart generator are excluded from this web import because their `shell-quote` dependency is blocked by the package firewall. Source is retained; `codegen` regenerates the web/API clients only.

## Architecture decisions

- Use this project's managed PostgreSQL database, not the supplied external Neon database.
- Preserve imported custom authentication; this is a repository import, not a new auth implementation.
- Keep direct OpenAI tier keys compatible when provided; otherwise use Replit AI Integrations.

## Product

_Describe the high-level user-facing capabilities of this app once they exist._

## User preferences

- Create only tables, fields, enums, indexes and relationships from the source schema. Do not copy data from Neon and do not seed old accounts or business records.

## Gotchas

_Populate as you build — sharp edges, "always run X before Y" rules._

## Pointers

- See the `pnpm-workspace` skill for workspace structure, TypeScript setup, and package details
